# **Host Guide**

Welcome to the Host Guide, a place for call hosts to get help, info, advice and best practices for conducting engaging and effective meetings.

Check the [Suggested Meeting Script section](#meeting-script-and-checklist) if you want more info for running a great meeting, and peruse the other sections for basic info and additional context. This documentation can be used as a template, the host can duplicate the guide and update the links to reflect their individual meeting or simply use it as a reference point in planning. 

## &#x23F0; Basic Meeting Event Info 

You can check the [Jupyter Community Meetings calendar](https://jupyter.org/community#calendar) for the exact time of each meeting in your time zone.

Each meeting should have a collaborative public agenda document (for example on HackMD). The agenda link should be included in the event’s description in the shared Google Calendar.

## &#x1F3AF; Meeting Purpose/Goals

Meetings are a way to connect members of our community. All participants should feel welcome and be heard. In line with that:

Meetings should be…

* Positive and friendly  
* Welcoming and open to people from diverse backgrounds  
* Newcomers in particular should be welcomed and encouraged to chime in, discuss, participate, or to simply observe if that is their preference.

## &#x1F4AC; Topics

Each meeting should have a list of topics that are generally discussed. Contributors can propose topics before or during the meeting.

(If using this document as a template, replace this section with a list of topics that are discussed at your meeting.)

## **Before the Meeting**

* Select date (at least 4 weeks in advance) and time  
  * In the past we’ve taken over JupyterLab weekly time slot. This encourages participation from subproject that is accustomed to meeting during a particular time. See example [email](sample_scripts.md#meeting-time-slot-request).  
* Create HackMD  
  * Create HackMD account   
  * Start a new note  
  * Use template [here](sample_scripts.md#hackmd-note-template)  
  * Set permissions (Edit mode, Read: Everyone, Write: Signed in Users\]  
  * Generate a link to use in announcements 
* Add the meeting to the community calendar
  * The [Project Jupyter community calendar](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/community/content-community.html#jupyter-community-meetings) (linked to projectjupyter@gmail.com) is used to share events with the broader Jupyter community. A number of people—including members of the EC, SSC, and others—already have access, including Martha.
    * Request Access or Delegate
        *  If you don’t have access to the calendar, ask someone who does to create the event for you. You can reach out to the EC or SSC if needed. Plan ahead and give at least two weeks’ notice—avoid last-minute requests.
    * Add the Event
        * If you do have access, open your calendar, use the left-hand navigation to select 'Project Jupyter', and create a 'new event'. Make sure to include: a link to the relevant blog post and Zoom details for the meeting or presentation
  * Once added, your event will automatically appear on the Jupyter community calendar.
* Announce date on public Jupyter channels  
  * Blog: [https://blog.jupyter.org/november-2024-jupyter-community-call-f5d0761c67a1](https://blog.jupyter.org/november-2024-jupyter-community-call-f5d0761c67a1)
    * [Sample blog post](sample_scripts.md#blog-post)
    * Get permissions  
      * Create an account on Medium  
      * Ask Jupyter Media Strategy (JMS) working group for permissions to be a writer on the [Jupyter blog](https://blog.jupyter.org/) by sending them an email: [jupyter-media-strategy@googlegroups.com](mailto:jupyter-media-strategy@googlegroups.com)  
    * Write blog post \+ social media posts  
      * Use draft as a template ([samples for blog and social media posts](sample_scripts.md#sample-scripts))  
    * Submit for JMS review  
      * See instructions here: [https://jupyter.org/social](https://jupyter.org/social)

## &#x1F4AA; Host Responsibilities

The host should facilitate the flow of a meeting. That means:

* Soliciting topics for the agenda:  
  * *Share the agenda document in the chat multiple times. On Zoom, for example, new participants do not see previous chat messages.*  
* Curate agenda topics  
  * Is the proposed speaker’s topic appropriate for this call?  
  * Is there enough time for all speakers?  
  * Any other measure that host deems is important as a public reflection of Project Jupyter  
* Going through the agenda:  
  * *Do time checks/pause \+ move on to hit all items when there are time concerns*  
* Guiding discussion:  
  * *Read chats aloud for participants \+ the recording*  
* Maintaining order / Making sure everyone has a chance to speak:  
  * *Interject when someone has their hand raised*  
* Mention/link to the [Jupyter Code of Conduct](https://jupyter.org/conduct) and how everyone is bound to it (including the host)

Partner with another contributor (who has recording privileges) to do the following:

* Record the meeting. The contributor you’re partnering with can start and stop the recording following your verbal cue. These are posted to YouTube.  
* Remove unwelcome recording bots:  
  * Per the Jupyter community page, participants should not record meetings on their own. The host should ask participants that look like AI recording bots:  
    * To identify themselves and state whether they’re recording  
    * If they get no response from the account, the host should assume it’s recording, and remove it from the meeting.

## &#x270f;  Meeting Checklist and Script

### &#x23F3; Prior to meeting start

* Make sure you have a solid tech environment that will allow you to focus on your hosting duties. This includes a stable internet connection, a good quality microphone, and a quiet environment.

The following message is recommended for Community Calls or similar events that engage with the broader contributor community:

> If you have any interest in sharing in future \[title\] calls, please do\! It doesn’t have to be a big share, a polished share, or a technical share, just show off what you do with Jupyter that excites you. Submit topics here \[platform/link\]. If you’re interested in hosting a community call, feel free to reach out. It would be great to get different people interacting with the community.

After the recording ends:

> If you have anything you would like to add off the record, please feel free to discuss that now.

### &#x1F389; After the Meeting

*Congratulations &#x1F680; on a finished meeting. Pat yourself on the back. Contributions like yours help to make the Jupyter community better\!*

A few post-meeting items for either the host or meeting-facilitator to complete:

* Finalize meeting minutes: Go back to the notes and make any needed additions, corrections and formatting needed in order to make the notes easy to understand by someone who did not participate in the meeting.  
* Publish the minutes:   
  1. Copy the contents of the minutes into a markdown file in this folder: [https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/tree/master/docs/source/community/community-call-notes](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/tree/master/docs/source/community/community-call-notes).  
  2. **You’ll also have to add a table of contents entry [here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/blob/master/docs/source/community/community-call-notes/index.rst) once you add the actual file.**   
* ***Upload video to YouTube***: You can share the link to the recording along with the thumbnail image for the video, with someone who has access to upload to the Project Jupyter YouTube channel. The thumbnail can be created from the slide here: [Video title slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E32UwXA81kqZG2Ruo8vBFYFSNPBLjh3PUYVHYiRhCBQ/edit?usp=drive_link)  
* Post recording on the following [thread on Discourse](%20https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/jupyter-community-calls/668/102?u=ruv7) (this link lives in the HackMD and should be kept up to date).

&#x1F305; The Jupyter community depends on volunteers like you, so again we would like to thank you for helping Jupyter bring open source tools for interactive computing to the world.

## Current System for Zoom Host Priviledges

To get the recording afterwards, you will need to have a person with host privileges request the recording from Linux Foundation.
