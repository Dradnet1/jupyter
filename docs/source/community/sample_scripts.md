## Blog Post
Hey Jovyans, we want to learn about the great things you’re doing with Jupyter! The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) standing committee is holding an open call with the community for people to discuss and share their work. Think of it as a “virtual JupyterCon”: It’s a place to announce and share new things happening in the Jupyter ecosystem.
We encourage brief (5 minutes or less) presentations with a demo or screen share, as needed. If you have a GitHub repo or demo web site, please remember to share it.
Anyone can attend, for free! Anyone can present; add yourself to the HackMD agenda. Anyone can sit in on the call. Presenters will lead a demo and may leave time to answer questions. Topics should be targeted to broad and global audience. Keep things simple and remember not every listener will be a software engineer.
Event details:
