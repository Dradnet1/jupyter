## Purpose

Think of it as a monthly, virtual JupyterCon. Itâ€™s a place to announce and share fun things happening in the Jupyter community.

For more discussion on the format of these calls, see the thread [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/jupyter-community-calls/668/101?u=ruv7).

## Short reports, celebrations, shout-outs

This is a place to make short announcements (without a need for discussion). 

* **Matt Fisher** The [GeoJupyter](https://geojupyter.org) open source community recently [announced its launch](https://geojupyter.org/blog/20250108-introducing-geojupyter/) and [started bi-weekly hackathons](https://geojupyter.org/blog/20250129-announcing-geojupyter-hackathons/). Hope you can join us to enable more people to confidently engage with geospatial data in JupyterLab! GeoJupyter is **NOT** an official Project Jupyter subproject.
